# Image

Facebook uses different aspect ratios depending on where the image or video is displayed.

### Aspect Ratio&#x20;

For best results, use the 4:5 portrait ratio (1080 x 1350 px) for feed posts, as it takes up more screen space and is supported across most sections.

* When posting multiple images, only the first image can have text and logo in it.
* As the aspect ratio varies depending on the number of images posted, make sure to refer to the following table.

| Number of images posted | Aspect Ratio of Displayed Image  |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| 1 Image                 | 4:5                              |
| 2 Images                | 1:1                              |
| 3 Images                | 2:3                              |
| 4 Images                | First image: 2:3 / The rest: 1:1 |
| 5 Images                | 1:1                              |

# Video Thumbnail

Since the aspect ratio of video thumbnails varies depending on the page, carefully consider which page you are creating content for.

### Aspect Ratio&#x20;

Given its mobile-oriented characteristics, we recommend using images sized 1920x1080 px in a 9:16 aspect ratio.\
However, 16:9 aspect ratio is recommended for landscape format content such as brand or campaign.

If you upload one thumbnail, it will be shown in the following aspect ratios in respective pages.

| Video Aspect Ratio | Location of Display | Aspect Ratio of Displayed Image |
| ------------------ | ------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| 9:16               | Feed                | 4:5                             |
| 9:16               | Full screen         | Vertical full screen            |
| 16:9               | FeedÂ·Full screen    | 16:9                            |

# Copy

As Facebook is based on user participation, develop copies that can encourage engagement, sharing and action-taking among its users.

#### Hook

* Short yet detailed copies before the ‘...more’ caption appears.\
  e.g., _Tap. Check. Relax.​_

#### Body

* This part should have bold, goal-oriented tones in them.
* The body should elaborate key benefits in a detailed language to suggest what actions a reader should take.\
  e.g., _Your Kia warranty and recall details, all in one handy app! Manage your vehicle smarter, right from your phone._

#### CTA

* We recommend inserting a clear, direct CTA copy in the last sentence.\
  e.g., _Download now \[Insert App Store / Country Link]_

#### Hashtag

* We recommend minimizing the use of hashtags.
* If necessary, you can use between zero to three hashtags that are appropriate for the brand.

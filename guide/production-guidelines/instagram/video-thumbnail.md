# Video Thumbnail

Since the aspect ratio of video thumbnails varies depending on the menu, carefully consider which menu you are creating content for.

### Aspect Ratio&#x20;

Given its mobile-oriented characteristics, we recommend using images sized 1920x1080 px in a 9:16 aspect ratio.\
If you upload one thumbnail, it will be shown in the following aspect ratios in respective menus.

| Location of Display | Aspect Ratio of Displayed Image |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Home Feed           | 5:8                             |
| Profile Feed        | 3:4                             |
| Search Feed         | 1:1, 1:2                        |
| Full Screen         | Vertical full screen            |

### Safe Zone

Arrange key visuals and text within the safe zone in consideration of the aspect ratios of each menu so that they do not get cropped.

### Layout

Uploaded images will be automatically shown in different aspect ratios according to each platform and exposure page. Make sure to produce content in consideration of the safe zone so as not to get cropped and follow the recommended aspect ratios for each platform.

#### Default Display Aspect Ratios

An original image (9:16) is shown in a 5:8 ratio in the Home feed while it is displayed in a 3:4 aspect ratio in the Profile feed.

# Copy

As Instagram is a visual-oriented platform, we need short copies that have aesthetic vibes.

#### Hook

* We recommend creating short, clear copies that can draw attention before the ‘...more’ appears in the caption.\
  e.g., _Tap. Check. Relax.​_

#### Body

* We recommend creating copies that are aesthetic, inspiring yet intuitive.
* In the body, we encourage writing key benefits and descriptions that support the hook.\
  e.g., _Your warranty info, always within reach.​_

#### CTA

* CTA is to encourage users to click the link in the profile to view information in detail. (Insert the link in the body.)

#### Hashtag

* In general, three to five (or up to ten) hashtags are recommended that best represent the brand.
* Required hashtags: #Kia #MovementThatInspires
